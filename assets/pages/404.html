  <blockquote class="bq-404">
    <p class="p-404">O! Wanderers in the shadowed land</p>
    <p class="p-404">despair not! For though dark they stand,</p>
    <p class="p-404">all woods there be must end at last,</p>
    <p class="p-404">and see the open sun go past:</p>
    <p class="p-404">the setting sun, the rising sun,</p>
    <p class="p-404">the day's end, or the day begun.</p>
    <span>J.R.R. Tolkien</span>

  <blockquote class="bq-404">
    <p class="p-404">All that is gold does not glitter,</p>
    <p class="p-404">Not all those who wander are lost;</p>
    <p class="p-404">The old that is strong does not wither,</p>
    <p class="p-404">Deep roots are not reached by the frost.</p>
    <p class="p-404">From the ashes a fire shall be woken,</p>
    <p class="p-404">A light from the shadows shall spring;</p>
    <p class="p-404">Renewed shall be blade that was broken,</p>
    <p class="p-404">The crownless again shall be king.</p>

  <blockquote class="bq-404">
    <p class="p-404">Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!</p>
    <p class="p-404">By water, wood and hill, by the reed and willow,</p>
    <p class="p-404">By fire, sun and moon, harken now and hear us!</p>
    <p class="p-404">Come, Tom Bombadil, for our need is near us!</p>

  <blockquote class="bq-404">
    <p class="p-404">Still round the corner there may wait</p>
    <p class="p-404">A new road or a secret gate</p>
    <p class="p-404">And though I oft have passed them by</p>
    <p class="p-404">A day will come at last when I</p>
    <p class="p-404">Shall take the hidden paths that run</p>
    <p class="p-404">West of the Moon and East of the Sun</p>

  <blockquote class="bq-404">
    <p class="p-404">The Road goes ever on and on,</p>
    <p class="p-404">Down from the door where it began.</p>
    <p class="p-404">Now far ahead the Road has gone,</p>
    <p class="p-404">And I must follow, if I can,</p>
    <p class="p-404">Pursuing it with eager feet,</p>
    <p class="p-404">Until it joins some larger way</p>
    <p class="p-404">Where many paths and errands meet.</p>
    <p class="p-404">And whither then? I cannot say.</p>
