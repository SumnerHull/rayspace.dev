    <h1 class="post-title">Minimalism in Web Development</h1>
    <p><b>Disclaimer: </b>This is not a call for all developers to drop frameworks and this is not aimed at discrediting
        any developer or their work, but rather to illustrate different philosophies in web
        development. While it's not about being anti-framework or proclaiming minimalism as the superior approach, it's
        more about shedding light on this viable, often underrated strategy.</p>
    <blockquote>

    </blockquote>
    <p>My journey of developing this site started with a search for minimalist developer portfolios. One of the websites
        that I came across was <a href="https://leerob.io/" target="_blank">Lee Robinson's portfolio</a>. It truly
        inspired me to utilize a similar minimalistic aesthetic.</p>
    <p>Lee uses Next.js, Tailwind CSS, PlanetScale, and Vercel; utilizing the best these technologies has to offer. But
        I had see if it would be feasible to re-create his design with just the foundational web technologies and Rust.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lee acknowledges Rust's benefits and the potential for it to become the <a
            href="https://leerob.io/blog/rust" target="_blank">future of JavaScript Infrastructure</a>. In this project,
        however, I wanted to use Rust for creating the entire backend including the webserver. By using Rust as the
        backend and avoiding any frameworks on the frontend, I wanted to experience the process of crafting a minimalist
        website first-hand.
    </p>
    <h2>'Why?' You might ask</h2>
    <p>While frontend frameworks can undoubtedly speed up the development process and help enforce some standards especially in
        larger teams with diverse skillsets, it's also true that they can introduce limitations and lack of control.</p>
    <p>For this website, I wanted absolute control and the barebones efficiency that only direct coding with HTML, CSS,
        and JavaScript could offer. Since I'm the solo developer on this project, the benefits of having more control
        heavily outweigh the benefits of using a frontend framework and I will touch on those points shorty.</p>
    <p>Are you happy with your frameworks? Are you dependent on them? Were you ever frustrated by the shortcomings or
        limitations of these frameworks?
        Regardless of how you answer those questions, minimalism presents a viable approach that's becoming
        increasingly accessible for all developers, with the potential to redefine the narrative in the web development
        arena.</p>
    <h2>The Philosophy</h2>
    <blockquote>
        "A well-used minimum suffices for everything."<span>Jules Verne</span>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Before we delve into the specifics of my approach, let's first clarify what minimalism in web development means.
        It's about more than just using lightweight options or achieving high performance. It's an ethos that values
        maintainability and control over complexity and convenience.</p>
    <p>It recognizes the importance of understanding the foundational principles of web development and not being overly
        reliant on frameworks and third-party dependencies. This philosophy influenced every decision I made while
        building my website.</p>
    <p>To be clear, I'm not advocating for this <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/"
            target="_blank">motherfuckingwebsite.com</a> level of web or design minimalism. Instead, I want to take
        advantage of the best and the latest but without introducing unnecessary limitations, complexity or bloat.</p>
    <h2>The Frontend</h2>
    <p>The first manifestation of my minimalist approach lies in the choice of technologies for frontend development.
        Despite the allure of modern frameworks, I opted to build the frontend with foundational web technologies—HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript. Having more control over the code means having more control over performance, security, and
        accessibility of your site. I will discuss these items further down the page.</p>
    <p>
        By just observing the live site and using nothing more than HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I was able to
        successfully recreate all of the interactive elements and features from Lee's site, such as the active link
        highlighting, dynamic meta tags, navigation, and styling of blog posts, buttons, and other elements.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have to admit, as I delved into the project, I became aware of the extensive thought and effort invested in
        Lee's site, which were far greater than my initial assumptions. Even though this created some additional
        challenges, it made the process more fun and increased my learning curve. Eventually, I was able to replicate
        the site with elevated flexibility, customizability and performance, while retaining the maintainability.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <b>Fun Fact: </b>I've built a Single Page Application (SPA) that emulates a Multi Page Application (MPA)
        behavior by modifying the URL and maintaining browser history. Lee’s site, as a contrast, is a MPA that behaves
        like a SPA.
    </blockquote>
    <p>However, this approach has not been without its trade-offs. One such trade-off to me was the absence of Server
        Side Rendering (SSR) that comes with React and Next.js. I really like how snappy Lee’s initial page loads are. I
        might revisit this aspect in the future and look for a way to implement SSR.</p>
    <p>
        With the adoption of <a href="https://webassembly.org" target="_blank">WebAssembly</a> on all major browsers,
        its now possible to run Rust directly in the browser with near-native performance. As a result, there are some
        Rust-based frontend frameworks that also offer SSR.
        One such framework is <a href="https://yew.rs/" target="_blank">Yew</a>. I'm interested to see how Yew compares
        to React and other frameworks, but that's a topic for another post.
    </p>
    <h2>The Backend</h2>
    <blockquote>
        "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."<span>Leonardo da Vinci</span>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I adopted a similar minimalist approach to backend development. As you already know by now, the backend of my
        website is built with Rust, typically a systems programming language known for its speed and memory safety. The
        speed and safety it guarantees made it a compelling choice for crafting an efficient, stripped-down, and an
        inherently minimalistic backend.</p>
    <p>In Rust, dependencies are called crates, and I had to be cognizant of my choices here. I wanted to implement all
        the desired features at the lowest level feasible. I compared several web server crates and <a
            href="https://actix.rs/" target="_blank">Actix Web</a> stood out as the most production-ready and barebones
        option. The web server provides the serving of the SPA along with REST endpoints. It also manages the user
        sessions and authentication for the guestbook section.
    </p>
    <p>Data management was entrusted to <a href="https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx" target="_blank">SQLx</a>, an async
        Rust crate that performs compile-time query checking, and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/"
            target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a>, a well-established, open-source relational database. In
        summary, my backend development journey with Rust has provided robust tools that provide extremely fast and safe
        webserver without the unnecessary overhead.</p>
    <h2>The Benefits</h2>
    <p>Adopting a minimalist approach can provide benefits in performance and security due to less third-party
        dependencies. With a more focused, efficient approach, a minimalist website can perform better and
        would potentially have less vulnerabilities.</p>
    <p>But to me, one of the most important items here is accessibility. Frameworks can simplify achieving accessibility
        to a great extent, but relying solely on them can be risky. I’ve seen developers build interfaces with frontend
        frameworks that fall short of the inclusive design.</p>
    <p>The path to a comprehensive understanding of accessibility isn’t through a magical framework, it requires an
        understanding of the HTML and CSS features and how your users actually interact with your site. Hence,
        irrespective of whether a framework is used or not, developers should have <s>a basic</s> proficiency in these
        accessibility standards and how to they translate to these core web technologies.</p>
    <p>Moreover, a minimalist approach grants you the freedom to utilize the latest, most innovative tech without
        waiting for their adoption in frameworks. Technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript shouldn't be treated as
        ancient relics to stay away from. They evolve and great new features are being added. We all want a better web,
        so why not be an early adopter in these core technologies?</p>
    <h2>The Abstraction Layers</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, my journey to embrace minimalism in web development is not a doctrine but a testament to the power
        and potential of foundational web technologies. While frameworks offer undeniable advantages as abstraction
        layers, returning to the basics provides an unparalleled level of control and room for customization. The
        critical task for every developer is to balance these considerations and make informed decisions based on their
        project's unique needs and constraints.
    </p>
    <p>Minimalism in web development isn't just a trend; it's a philosophy — one that encourages a holistic
        understanding of web technologies and a dedication to crafting efficient, accessible, and responsive web
        experiences.</p>
    <p>In an era where generative AI might emerge as a new abstraction layer for web application development,
        minimalism, aided by such advancements, could take a more prominent role. It's an exciting prospect that might
        influence future trends in web development. After all, as developers, our pursuit should always be for cleaner,
        simpler, and more efficient solutions.</p>
