# rayspace.dev
ðŸ¦€ My portfolio built with Rust and native web technologies.

## Overview
The design of this site is inspired by the work of [Lee Robinson](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io), but diverges in technical implementation.

This is a full stack application built with rust and core web technologies. It uses Actix Web for the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend. The project also uses a Post>

## Running Locally
If you are familiar with Rust, you can build the app from source and run your own instance. To build and run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Rust installed. You can install Rust by following the [official guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

2. Clone this repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ryspc/rayspace.dev.git
cd rayspace.dev
```
3. Set the required environment variables.
* Create .env file at project root.
* Required variables are within .env_mock

4. Build and run the application.
```bash
cargo build
cargo run
```
5. The server will start, by default it runs on `http://localhost:3000`.

6. (Optional) If using HAProxy for reverse proxy and/or rate limiting, ensure that HAProxy is installed and properly configured.
